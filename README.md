# Installation
Set up a conda environment and install `jupyter`. 
I used python version 3.12.3. 
See `environment.yml` in case you're interested in the other package versions.

In the conda console window, navigate into the `ProtONT` folder (the one where setup.py is located) and run `pip install -e .` to install the package (if `pip` is not installed, install it before).

Then you should be able to use the package from your conda environment, e.g. to run the example notebook `demonotebook_ProtONT.ipynb`.
